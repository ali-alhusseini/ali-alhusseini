## Design Inspiration
This is my first attempt at buildign my own website from scratch by purely using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. I have an obsession with music and especially album arts. 
So I decied to design my website around that idea of an album art. The desktop version looks slightly different from the mobile one. On desktop, you would see a box
with the title and naviagation and the box that fills the other half of the screen is the content. I'm currently working on a default musical/visual interface that 
acts as a placeholder when the user hasn't navigated to a page. The mobile version on the other hand, is more like a business card that only has essential information 
and links and can be saved as a contact card.
